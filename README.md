## About Me

My key areas of interest (relative to this degree) are in statistical learning, high-dimensional econometrics, nonparametric & semiparametric methods and causal inference. 

Outside of this degree, I have academic interests in, broadly speaking, applied mathematics, philosophy of mathematics, logic, rogue waves, and data visualization.  More loosely, I practice sleight of hand with magic cards, calisthenics, and play non-contact sports (tennis, pickleball, table tennis, and swimming).

## Data Science Projects

#### [Tracking Depressive Symptom Rates in America](https://github.com/jcmazzola/depression_rates)

University of Connecticut - Data Science Capstone

As part of my Spring 2025 capstone, I conducted an in-depth analysis of how reported depression symptoms varied across demographic groups in the United States. Using data from the CDC’s Household Pulse Survey, this project examined trends in adult depression rates from May 2020 to August 2024. The objective was to uncover disparities across age, sex, race, education, and geographic regions, providing insight into the social and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis employed non-parametric statistical tests to assess significant differences in symptom reporting across subgroups.

**Keywords:** age, education, ethnicity, mental health, pandemic, race, sex, state

#### [Field Hockey APC Analysis](https://github.com/jcmazzola/Field_Hockey_APC_analysis.git)

University of Connecticut– Sports Statistical Learning Internship

In the Fall 2024 semester, I had the opportunity to collaborate with UConn's Field Hockey team through the UConn Sports Statistical Learning Internship. This experience allowed me to investigate various factors influencing the success of attacking penalty corners. My aim was to provide actionable insights that could help enhance team strategies and improve performance outcomes.

This project is part of my broader effort to apply data science across a diverse range of fields, contributing valuable analysis to real-world challenges.

**Keywords:** Sports analysis, scoring rate, Extreme Gradiant Boosting, feature importance, opponent analysis, classification, Plotnine, python.

#### [Data Visualization with Plotnine](https://github.com/jcmazzola/Visualization_with_Plotnine.git)

This class note contribution focuses on Plotnine, a Python library for creating visually appealing and effective visualizations. It includes examples and explanations of the various ways to customize visualizations, making them both user-friendly and informative. These resources are designed to help students develop skills they can apply in their careers, whether in corporate settings or academia.

These notes were presented to the Dr. Jun Yan's Fall 2024 Introduction to Data Science class.

**Keywords:** Plotnine, python, lesson contribution, grammar of graphics, visualization, readability, facet plots, scatterplot, bar chart, histogram, line chart, regression line, customization.
   
#### [NASDAQ Composite Index Prediction](https://github.com/jcmazzola/NASDAQ_Prediction.git)

This project applies statistical learning techniques to predict the NASDAQ Composite Index, combining my interests in Economics and Data Science. Using historical stock data from January 4, 2010, to October 25, 2024, the analysis identifies key predictors of stock price movements, examines the impact of seasonality, and evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models for time-series forecasting.

**Keywords:** Moving Average, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Python, Plotnine, feature importance analysis, time-series forecasting, feature engineering, financial analysis
